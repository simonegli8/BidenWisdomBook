We are Art, Michelle, and Steve, 3 “grass-rooters” from Wisconsin, with a vision as improbable as Joe Biden’s candidacy:
enough books on enough coffee tables so that every American has direct access to the words, wit, and wisdom of Joe Biden.
<br><br>
<b><i>We have been forever changed by this election, and we look forward to a brighter
  tomorrow with hope in our hearts. Thank you, America.</i></b>

As the world has learned during the course of this campaign, Joe Biden is arguably one of the most eloquent, inspirational, and transformational
leaders of our time. Hear him speak and you’ll believe in the possibilities for our future.
<a href="find.html"><b><i>Read his words</i></b></a>
and understand how real hope can change the world.
<br><br>
We created BidenWisdomBook.com to fill a need during this past election. Americans
needed access to Joe Bidens's quotes - unfiltered and undistorted - in order to make an
informed decision in the voting booth.
<br><br>
Now that the election is over, the need is even greater. <b><i>We each must continue to care,
continue to hope, and continue to participate in the future of our country.</i></b>
And a large part of doing that is to hold President-elect Biden accountable to what we as a
people want OUR America to become.
